how to uninstall elasticsearch from ubuntu completely with the directory locations as well 
ChatGPT said:
To completely uninstall Elasticsearch from Ubuntu along with all directories, follow this safe and thorough step-by-step:

⚠️ WARNING:

This will delete ALL your data and configs, including indices and user info.

🧼 Step-by-Step Uninstall Guide:

1. 🛑 Stop the Elasticsearch service
sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch
2. 🧽 Uninstall Elasticsearch packages
If installed via apt:

sudo apt-get purge elasticsearch
sudo apt-get autoremove
3. 🧹 Delete all Elasticsearch-related directories
Here are the default locations to wipe:

Type	Default Path
Config files	/etc/elasticsearch
Data	/var/lib/elasticsearch
Logs	/var/log/elasticsearch
PID / Runtime	/run/elasticsearch (if exists)
Journal files	/var/log/journal (optional)
Custom locations	Check your elasticsearch.yml
sudo rm -rf /etc/elasticsearch
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/elasticsearch
sudo rm -rf /var/log/elasticsearch
sudo rm -rf /run/elasticsearch
4. 🔍 Optional: Remove leftover user/group
sudo userdel elasticsearch
sudo groupdel elasticsearch
5. 🧹 Check systemd leftovers (optional but clean)
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl reset-failed
✅ Done!
Elasticsearch is now completely removed from your system.

If you're going to reinstall, a clean rebootstrap of the cluster will now behave like a fresh install.

Want help setting that up again with proper roles?
