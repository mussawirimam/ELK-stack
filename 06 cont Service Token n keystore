What keystore is?
keystore is kind of encrypted safe, where we can store our keys.
Which we cannot directly into the elasticsearch configuration file. How we configure
those files, here in our keystore. We will understand that and how we access those files.

### we are going to run this command to generate the service token key
# this command says: Hey elasticsearch service token, create elastic user kibana and folder kibana 
./elasticsearch-service-tokens create elastic users folder /kibana name of the token =  kibana_token

# we got error because the token already exists.
root@matrix:/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin# ./elasticsearch-service-tokens create elastic/kibana kibana_token
ERROR: Service token [elastic/kibana/kibana_token] already exists, with exit code 70
root@matrix:/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin# 

### we can choose another name and the new service token key will be created. 
### we can use this token to authenticate elasticsearch user
root@matrix:/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin# ./elasticsearch-service-tokens create elastic/kibana kibana_token1
SERVICE_TOKEN elastic/kibana/kibana_token1 = AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMva2liYW5hL2tpYmFuYV90b2tlbjE6eW5tRVVVSnZRUHlQTjZNRElNbjZNUQ

# if we will configure id and password in plain text in any config file, suppose 

root@matrix:/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin# cd /etc/kibana/
root@matrix:/etc/kibana# ls
certs  kibana.keystore  kibana.yml  node.options
root@matrix:/etc/kibana#

### let's suppose
### this is the configuration file of kibana kibana.yml, where we configured our elasticsearch username and password in plaintext.
If anyone has the access to the server, they will be able to get away with the admin password.
if suppose if the server access is with 5 people but the administrator doesnt want to spread the super-user credentails with the junior members.
But they have access to the server for other reason or maybe they want to do different task on a server, in that case how to secure your ELk? 
or maybe the server is accessible someone else, in that case also they will be able to read the credential that has been placed in plain text. 
we can configure the credentials in a keystore.
Now we are going to learn about how to configure the token.

### suppose, I removed the credentials from the kibana.yml file. I will have to configure the token in that case. 
### this concept is similar to creating the personal access token on the github to get the access to your repository through API's on your CLI.
vi /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
# =================== System: Elasticsearch ===================
# The URLs of the Elasticsearch instances to use for all your queries.
#elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
elasticsearch.hosts: ["https://sys.fcc:9200"]
#elasticsearch.hosts: ["https://172.17.154.9:9200"]

# If your Elasticsearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide
# the username and password that the Kibana server uses to perform maintenance on the Kibana
# index at startup. Your Kibana users still need to authenticate with Elasticsearch, which
# is proxied through the Kibana server.
#elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system"
#elasticsearch.password: "123456789"

# Kibana can also authenticate to Elasticsearch via "service account tokens".                                     # Service account tokens are Bearer style tokens that replace the traditional username/password based configuration.
# Use this token instead of a username/password.
#elasticsearch.serviceAccountToken: "AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMva2liYW5hL2tpYmFuYV90b2tlbjE6eW5tRVVVSnZRUHlQTjZNRElNbjZNUQ"     <------------------------------ # for now commenting out, since we are going to use the keystore for authentication
                                                                                                                 # Time in milliseconds to wait for Elasticsearch to respond to pings. Defaults to the value of
                                                  
### That's one part, now second part is suppose we dont want the token visible within the kibana.yml file
I will take the token key and 
root@matrix:/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin# cd /usr/share/kibana/bin/
root@matrix:/usr/share/kibana/bin# ls
kibana                  kibana-health-gateway  kibana-plugin  kibana-verification-code
kibana-encryption-keys  kibana-keystore        kibana-setup
root@matrix:/usr/share/kibana/bin#

# we are going to tell kibana for any id and password, you will have to read it through the keystore and what keystore configuration we are saving here?
# we are saving id and password token. 
# keystore is like a encrypted file
### we are going to use kibana binaries to add the token in the keystore for encrypted authentication. 

root@matrix:/usr/share/kibana/bin# ./kibana-keystore add elasticsearch.serviceAccountToken
Enter value for elasticsearch.serviceAccountToken: **************************************************************************
root@matrix:/usr/share/kibana/bin#

### if you want to remove the token key from keystore
#root@matrix:/usr/share/kibana/bin# ./kibana-keystore remove elasticsearch.serviceAccountToken
root@matrix:/usr/share/kibana/bin# ^C



### we are going to restart the kibana so it can undertand the keystore
### kibana.yml doesnt have any values entered for credential in plain text or any token inserted. Because we have added the token in the keystore and the kibana will be using the keystore authentication
