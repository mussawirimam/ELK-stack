we will create 3 elasticsearch and one kibana server
we will follow same steps for installation but we have to start the elasticsearch sequentially.
If you start 1st server needs to be the master and then following 2nd elasticsearch and 3rd elasticsearch node needs to be start via systemctl
To make less mistakes, try to install sequentially as well and save all of their passwords in one file
the configuration will be different from how you did configuration on the single node cluster. 
Environment: aws
