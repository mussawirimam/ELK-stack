NOTE: by default when you put an index in the elasticsearch, it applies ECS ( Elasticsearch Comman Schema )
on ECS: ECS is a standardized field naming convention developed by Elastic to bring uniformity to data across different sources like logs, metrics, traces, etc.

creating index pattern:
go to stack management > under kibana, Data Views > click on Create Data view and add the index name and index pattern


documents exists within the index and index is viewed through the data view:
document > index > dataview  

to view the mapping datatypes for the fields:
stack management > under kibaana, Data Views > click on the index to see the fields mapping



ON INDEX TEMPLATE
------------------
example if you have multiple indexes starting with logs, you can apply the index template and create a dataview upon which all the seperate indexes with simiar naming convention, you will be able to see in one dataview to manage and search them. 
logs-123
logs-456
logs-789



### whichever logs that gets started with the logs-(xyz)*, the index template will be applied to those indexes
### any index starting with the log-(xyz)*, will be considered to be apply the template below 
### you are also mapping the fields with this index template to the field and its DataType
PUT _index_template/testing_temp
{
  "index_patterns": ["logs-*"], 
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 1,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": {
          "type": "date"
        },
        "message": {
          "type": "text"
        },
        "status_code": {
          "type": "integer"
        }
      }
    }


### now we are posting the index and document which index template will find the pattern and apply the settings and mappings to it
POST logs-2024-03/_doc/1
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-04T12:00:00",
  "message": "User logged in successfully",
  "status_code": 200
}
