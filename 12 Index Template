NOTE: by default when you put an index in the elasticsearch, it applies ECS ( Elasticsearch Comman Schema )
on ECS: ECS is a standardized field naming convention developed by Elastic to bring uniformity to data across different sources like logs, metrics, traces, etc.
which in turn applies default DATATYPES to the filed 

- to specify custom DATATYPES, you will have to create custom fields for you documents that are coming in the index. 
Q: why DATATYPE is important? it is for the search reasons and tokenization. E.g text is not aggregatable but the keywords are.


creating index pattern:
go to stack management > under kibana, Data Views > click on Create Data view and add the index name and index pattern


documents exists within the index and index is viewed through the data view:
document > index > dataview  

to view the mapping datatypes for the fields:
stack management > under kibaana, Data Views > click on the index to see the fields mapping




EXAMPLE CREATING THE INDEX TEMPLATE THROUGH API:
----------------------------------------
ON INDEX TEMPLATE
------------------
docuemnt > index pattern > index > index template
documents are added to the indexes document > index and indexes have patterns on the data view. > any index pattern that is defined in the index template, gets filter through the index template. > index template
example if you have multiple indexes starting with logs, you can apply the index template and create a dataview upon which all the seperate indexes with simiar naming convention, you will be able to see in one dataview to manage and search them. 
logs-123
logs-456
logs-789



### whichever logs that gets started with the logs-(xyz)*, the index template will be applied to those indexes
### any index starting with the log-(xyz)*, will be considered to be apply the template below 
### you are also mapping the fields with this index template to the field and its DataType

PUT _index_template/testing_temp
{
  "index_patterns": ["logs-*"], 
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 1,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": {      <-------------------- if the index will have the field called timestamp, it will apply the DATATYPE called date.
          "type": "date"
        },
        "message": {
          "type": "text"
        },
        "status_code": {
          "type": "integer"
        }
      }
    }


### now we are posting the index and document through a simple payload, to which the index template will find the pattern and apply the settings and mappings to it
POST logs-2024-03/_doc/1
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-04T12:00:00",
  "message": "User logged in successfully",
  "status_code": 200
}


### to look for the index that has been created
stack management > clikc on index template > click management on top right hand corner drop down menu and click on the testing_temp index template review it. 
h.w learn aobut the "_tier_preference": "data_content" (its going to be under the review template > preview once you have click on your index template)

### THE INSTRUCTOR KEEP ON MAKING MISTAKES, SO FOLLOW FROM HERE FOR INDEX TEMPLATE, THE ABOVE INDEX TEMPLATE IS MAKING A DATASTREAM BECAUSE THE DOCUEMNT DOESNT HAVE THE INDEX
### why the upper one is creating a data stream?
DELETE _index_template/my_index_template
PUT _index_template/my_index_template
{
  "index_patterns": ["my-index-*"], 
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 1,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": {
          "type": "date"
        },
        "user": {
          "type": "keyword"
        },        
        "message": {
          "type": "text"
        },
        "status_code": {
          "type": "integer"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

DELETE my-index-2025-03
PUT my-index-2025-03

DELETE my-index-2025-03/_doc/1
POST my-index-2025-03/_doc/1
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-04T12:00:00",
  "message": "User logged in successfully",
  "status_code": 200
}

--------------------------
DATASTREM
-------------------------
to put the datastream in the in elasticsearch:
you have to define the method to add the datastream in elasticsearch
