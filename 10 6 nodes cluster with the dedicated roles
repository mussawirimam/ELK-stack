We will create 6 nodes now and install elasticsearch and copy the certs and copy the configuration elasticsearch.yml file in all 3 master nodes
# we will be working with 3 roles: master, cordinator, and datanodes.

node1 master 10.211.55.11  node.roles: [ master ]
node2 master 10.211.55.12  node.roles: [ master ]
node3 master 10.211.55.13  node.roles: [ master ]

node4 cordinator 10.211.55.22  node.roles: [ cordinator ]

node5 datanode 10.211.55.23
node6 datanode 10.211.55.24

right now we are not using these nodes

### to setup the roles
https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/distributed-architecture/clusters-nodes-shards/node-roles
### there are multiple nodes that you can set in your elasticsearch.yml file to tell your cluster what roles they are going to server. 
Set node roles
You define a node’s roles by setting node.roles in elasticsearch.yml. If you set node.roles, the node is only assigned the roles you specify. If you don’t set node.roles, the node is assigned the following roles:
master
data
data_content
data_hot
data_warm
data_cold
data_frozen
ingest
ml
remote_cluster_client
transform

### we will add this role within this sectio of the elasticsearch.yml file
vi elasticsearch.yml
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: future
nodes.roles: [ master ]
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
:wq!


### change the permissions look at the 02 ELK installation doc
# then start the elasticsearch service
### you will get error because, there is no data node available. Since there is no data node to store data, you will then you will not be able to interact with anything since first 3 nodes are master only.
