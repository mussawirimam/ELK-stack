# elastic is A distributed architecture. 
what is a distribution terminology
The elasticsearch for avoiding fault tolerance and will be resilient, it has a distributed data across all the server. 
based on the our configuration defined in the index template for index. Index configuration will be defined in the index template and how this configuration is applied?
based on the pattern which we define in the index template and settings 
shard will be 1
replica will be 4 
etc

replicas needs to be o different servers, because if one server is lost and there are two replicas on the same server than 2 will be lost incase the server is down. 
our data will be highly availabe with the distributed data.
